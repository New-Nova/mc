      <h2 id="getstarted">Getting started</h2>
      <p> <span class="highlight">New Nova is a towny 1.21.3 minecraft server based on the discontinued nova map from EarthMC</span>. This
        guide will get you started on getting started yet again on nova. <span class="highlight">Join using the address newnova.blockworlds.io</span>,
        join our <a href="https://discord.gg/fSS5RGaY7R">Discord server.</a>
        We are gonna guess if you're joining New Nova you understand the basics of towny or have played EarthMC before.
        So here's some information if you owned a town in the previous EarthMC map. 
        Your town will be there; however, if you have changed your username, you will need to contact a staff member to get your town back.
        The town spawns and nation spawns have also been reset to a random point in your town. Make sure to run /t set spawn and /n set spawn to set your town and nation spawn to somewhere else.
        If you have any other questions, feel free to ask in the Discord server.</p> 


      <h2 id="dynmap">Dynmap</h2>
      <p> The interactive web map can be found at <a
          href="http://newnova.blockworlds.io:8123">http://newnova.blockworlds.io:8123</a>. This is a
        great tool to navigate the map. A head icon with your name and skin marks your location on the server. If you
        can't find yourself on the map, make sure to check your coordinates in-game and compare them to coordinates
        displayed on the map. Below the coordinates, you will find a menu where territory borders can be toggled. Move
        the mouse to the right of the screen to open a larger black menu. Here you can see who is online. </p>
      <h2 id="town">Creating a town</h2>
      <p> <span class="highlight">In order to create a town, you need 64 gold</span> in your inventory. Make sure your
        stand in the area you want to settle your town in before running the command. Once you're ready, open chat and
        type: </p>
      <div class="highlight-code">
        <div class="code-bg"> <code class="markdown"><span>/t new &lt;Town_Name_Here&gt;</span></code> </div>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <p> Make sure your town name does not include a space or any special characters. Towns are safe from raiding and
        looting. Towns can only be raided during war only if they fall into ruin when deleted.
        Mayors (the player that created the town) can toggle taxes, pvp, etc. For more info, do: </p>
      <div class="highlight-code">
        <div class="code-bg"> <code class="markdown"><span>/t toggle</span></code> </div>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <p> <span class="highlight">In order to expand your town one chunk, you have to pay 16 gold (Note: The more chunks you claim the more gold you have to pay.)</span> and run: </p>
      <div class="highlight-code">
        <div class="code-bg"> <code class="markdown"><span>/t claim</span></code> </div>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <p> This command will let you add town residents: </p>
      <div class="highlight-code">
        <div class="code-bg"> <code class="markdown"><span>/t add &lt;Player_Name_Here&gt;</span></code> </div>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <p> All towny commands are listed on the official towny website, <a target="_blank"
          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200729194403/https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/Towny-Commands">here</a>.
        In doubt, run: </p>
      <div class="highlight-code">
        <div class="code-bg"><code class="markdown"><span>/t ?</span></code></div>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <p> Towns where mayors haven't ever joined the server get randomly chosen to get deleted daily. Once you join the server once, your town is safe from deletion.</p>
      <h2 id="nation">Joining a nation</h2>
      <p> A nation is a collection of towns with one town as the capital. The town which created the nation is set as
        capital by default. Your town will get several benefits by joining a nearby nation. You will have access to
        teleport to the capital where much of the nation's trade is done. You also have access to other capitals your
        nation is allied to. In order to join a nation your town has to be within 3000 blocks of the capital (you can
        measure the distance on the dynmap). </p>
      <p>To create your own nation you have to pay 1024 gold from your town vault. Your town will become the nation's
        capital and town mayor will become nation king. Make sure you name your nation after the IRL country where it is
        located on the map. You can also name it after past nations. You can name your nation fictional names just avoid using
        special characters and follow the rules. </p>
      <div class="highlight-code">
        <div class="code-bg"><code class="markdown"><span>/n new &lt;Nation_Name_Here&gt;</span></code></div>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <h2 id="ranks">Ranks</h2>
      <p>You can set different ranks for your town/nation members. This gives you the power to limit access, but also
        grant your residents different capabilities. </p>
      <div class="highlight-code">
        <div class="code-bg"><code
            class="markdown"><span>/town rank add &lt;Player_Name Rank_Name&gt;</span> or <span>/nation rank add &lt;Player_Name Rank_Name&gt;</span></code>
        </div>
      </div>
